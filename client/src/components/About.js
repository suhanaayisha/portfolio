                    Hi there! <br/>
                    I am a computer science graduate who is passionate about web and software development. I stumbled into this field
                    by chance, but the more I got into it, the more I loved it. As a web developer, I use the skills, knowledge and experience that 
                    I have, to develop things that make a difference. I hope to contribute to
                    growth of the organization while constantly learning and improving my own skills overtime.    
                </p>
